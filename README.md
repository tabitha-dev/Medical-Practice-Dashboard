The **Medical IT Solutions Dashboard** is a single-page web application designed to showcase the core functionalities of a modern medical practice management system. This project serves as a demonstration of front-end development skills using vanilla web technologies, simulating various interactions and data flows without a live backend.

It provides a comprehensive overview of patient management, appointment scheduling, billing, and system configurations, all within an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Key Features & Simulated Functionality

This mockup provides a comprehensive simulated experience of a medical practice management system:

* **üìä Dashboard Overview:**
    * **Holistic KPI Scorecards:** Displays key metrics like "Total Appointments," "Patient Satisfaction," "Average Wait Time," and "Monthly Revenue" with simulated trend indicators.
    * **Interactive Trend Charts:** Visualizes "Appointment Trends" and "Patient Distribution" using simulated data.
    * **Advanced Analytics Modal:** A floating button provides access to a detailed modal with simulated "Advanced Practice Analytics" including performance metrics, growth trends, and AI recommendations.

* **üìÖ Appointment Management:**
    * **Daily View:** Displays a list of today's appointments with details like patient name, doctor, type, time, and status. Includes actions for editing, checking in, and canceling appointments.
    * **Weekly View:** Provides a simulated overview of appointments for the current week (Sunday to Saturday), showing the number of appointments per day.
    * **Calendar View:** Offers a simulated monthly calendar highlighting days with appointments and providing a summary of appointment counts.
    * **New Appointment Booking:** A dedicated section to book new appointments with input fields for patient details, visit type, and time slot selection.

* **üë• Patient Management:**
    * **Comprehensive Patient List:** Displays mock patient data including contact information, last visit, next appointment, insurance, balance, and status.
    * **Client-Side Filtering:** Allows users to search patients by name/ID and filter by status (Active, Inactive, New Patients) and insurance provider.
    * **Patient Actions:** Buttons for viewing, editing patient information, and directly scheduling appointments.

* **üí∞ Billing & Payment Management:**
    * **Financial Overview:** Presents key financial metrics like "Total Revenue," "Outstanding," "Insurance Claims," and "Overdue" amounts.
    * **Billing Table:** Lists mock invoices with details such as Invoice ID, patient, service, date, amount, insurance details, and status.
    * **Billing Actions:** Simulated actions for creating invoices, processing payments, generating reports, viewing invoices, sending invoices, and recording payments.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Settings Management:**
    * **Tabbed Navigation:** Organized settings into logical tabs: Practice Information, User Management, Notifications, Integrations, and Security.
    * **Practice Information:** Configure general practice details like name, license, contact info, and address.
    * **User Management:** View a list of simulated users with their roles and status, and perform mock actions like adding, editing, or deleting users.
    * **Notifications:** Manage preferences for email, SMS, and push notifications, including reminder timings.
    * **Integrations:** View and toggle connection status for various simulated third-party integrations (EHR, Telehealth, Payment Gateway, etc.).
    * **Security:** Options for changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and viewing a recent activity log.

* **‚ùì Help & Documentation:**
    * **FAQs:** Provides answers to frequently asked questions about using the system.
    * **User Guides & Tutorials:** Simulated links to detailed guides on various functionalities.
    * **Support Contact:** Information to reach the support team.

* **üì± Mobile Responsiveness:**
    * The layout adapts gracefully to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), ensuring usability across devices.
    * Tables intelligently collapse columns using container queries on narrower screens for optimal viewing.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using fundamental web technologies, emphasizing a lightweight and client-side approach:

* HTML5
* Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript

---

## How It Works

The application operates entirely within the browser, simulating complex functionalities using in-memory mock data and client-side JavaScript logic.

1.  **Initial Load:** The application loads directly to the Dashboard.
2.  **Data Simulation:** All data (KPIs, patient accounts, chart data, etc.) is generated dynamically using JavaScript arrays and objects within the browser's memory. There is no persistent backend database.
3.  **Dynamic Rendering:** JavaScript manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically update content, filter lists, and display simulated results based on user interactions.
4.  **Simulated Actions:** Buttons and form interactions trigger JavaScript functions that update in-memory data, display custom alerts/confirms, or render new content, giving the impression of complex operations.
5.  **Navigation:** Section switching (Dashboard, Appointments, Patients, Billing, Settings, Help & Docs) is handled by toggling the `display` CSS property of different content sections.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tabitha-dev/Medical-Practice-Dashboard.git](https://github.com/tabitha-dev/Medical-Practice-Dashboard.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Medical-Practice-Dashboard
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or use a local server extension (like Live Server for VS Code) for convenience.

## Future Enhancements Ideas

To evolve this mockup into a more feature-rich and robust application, consider these enhancements:

* **Persistent Data Storage:** Integrate a lightweight client-side database (e.g., IndexedDB) or, for a more advanced version, a cloud-based NoSQL database (like Firebase Firestore) to persist user data across sessions.
* **Advanced Charting Library:** Replace custom canvas drawing with a professional JavaScript charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) for more complex visualizations and built-in interactivity.
* **Enhanced Drill-down:** Implement multi-level drill-down capabilities where clicking a chart segment filters related tables and other charts, providing deeper root-cause analysis.
* **Predictive Analytics Integration:** Integrate a simple machine learning model (even client-side, using libraries like TensorFlow.js) to generate more sophisticated future forecasts for KPIs.
* **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities, adding ARIA attributes and improving keyboard navigation.
* **User Authentication & Roles:** Implement a more robust mock authentication system with different user roles having truly distinct views and permissions.
* **Customizable Dashboards:** Allow users to rearrange, resize, and select which KPI cards and charts are visible on their dashboard.
